This intervention is composed of two lectures:
* The [first lecture](https://github.com/jonathandumas/ELEC0018-1-energy-markets/blob/f36c58b19999741589477c461f37436d5e14e6c8/pdf/Energy_market_2020_lesson_1.pdf) focuses on the residential energy supplier. It provides the basics of the energy supplier perimeter and how to build a "green" energy offer.
* The [second lecture](https://github.com/jonathandumas/ELEC0018-1-energy-markets/blob/f36c58b19999741589477c461f37436d5e14e6c8/pdf/Energy_market_2020_lesson_2.pdf) addresses the residential electricity pricing offer.

# Reminder

The average Belgian:
* electricity consumption per household is between 3 000 and 5 000 kWh.
* gas (heat) consumption per household is between 10 000 and 20 000 kWh.

1 kWh = energy to carry 100 kg from sea level (0 m) to 3 600 m!

1 kWh = 13 km by foot, 2 km by car, 1 kg of TNT...

1 L of oil = 10 kWh.
